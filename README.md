# my-vimrc
This repository contains my personal vimrc file.
You can do almost whatever you want with it ("almost" because of the license restrictions).

## About
This vimrc is based on [minimal-vimrc.vim](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore/blob/master/contents/minimal-vimrc.vim) from [mhinz/vim-galore](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-galore/) but it as a lot of other features.
It is not inteded to be a "good" vimrc and much less "the better" vimrc in the world (provided that such vimrc exists): it is just my personal vimrc and it works perfectly for me.

## Contributing
If you find something that doesn't work or if you know a better way to do something feel free to contribute with an issue or with a pull request.
If you would like to add a new feature, fork the repo and add the new feature to your fork but don't send me a pull request.
