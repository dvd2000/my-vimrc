# my-vimrc
This repository contains my personal vimrc file.
You can do almost whatever you want with it ("almost" because of the license restrictions): you can use it as an inspiration or use it as your personal vimrc.

## Contributing
If you find something that doesn't work or if you know a better way to do something feel free to contribute with an issue or with a pull request.
If you would like to add a new feature, fork the repo and add the new feature to your fork but don't send me a pull request.

## License
